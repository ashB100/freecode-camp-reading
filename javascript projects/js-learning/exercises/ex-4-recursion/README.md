# ex-4-recursion

In this exercise, you'll write a function that adds up all of the numbers in an array that contains both numbers and additional arrays of numbers. (See data/arraysOfArrays.js.) Write code in index.js to make the tests in test.js pass.

When the tests pass, running test.js will output "tests ok"; if any tests fail, you will see errors instead.
