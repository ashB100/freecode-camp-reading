# notes

* step over I was somewhat familiar with; step into is neat!
* it's very cool that you can run `--inspect` and get it in the browser; much easier/cooler than creating a HTML file and opening that to get to the inspector :ok_hand:
* mild bummer that the chrome-devtools link can't be opened with cmd-click from the terminal like other URLs, though.
