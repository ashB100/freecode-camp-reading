# Instructions on how to start your project

* Step 1:  From GitHub, copy the currency-converter directory to your local computer.

* Step 2: If you don't have Node installed, then please install the 'LTS' version of Node [from this link](https://nodejs.org/en/). This is the first green button on the page and is the version with long term support.

* Step 3: From the command line prompt, change directory to the directory where you copied the current-converter files from step 1.  

  For example:
  
  <code>$ cd my-projects/currency-converter</code>
  
  <small>Note<sup>*</sup>: You don't have to type $, it is just there to show that you're in the command line.</small>
  
* Step 4: Install the dependencies needed by your project by running the following command:

  <code>$ npm install</code>

* Step 5. Serve your application by running the following command:

  <code>$ npm run dev</code>
  
* Step 6. This should open your application in the browser. You will see a default message on the browser which you can replace with your own code in index.html. 

Now you can start working on your project!
